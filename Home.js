        <p>Leveraging on 17 years of success and experience in education, The Educators has experienced phenomenal growth to become the country's largest school network. With over 900+ Schools and a student body exceeding 200,000+, The Educators has created over 9,000 job opportunities in a relatively short period of time. The overall aim of the organisation is to provide a quality learning environment for students and quality training for the faculty through excellence in education within the relevant socio-cultural framework of Pakistan. The Educators' success lies both in its strong brand as well as its ability to continuously add new products and services for its Network Associates.</p>
 
        <p>Established in 2002 in Pakistan, The Educators is a parallel private school network owned and operated by Beaconhouse that aims to impart a standardized quality of education across the nation at a tuition fee that is a fraction of the fee charged at Beaconhouse. The Educators operates through a model of network associates (franchisees) in which Beaconhouse is the franchisor/service provider.</p>
